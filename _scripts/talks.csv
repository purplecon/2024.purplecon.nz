iain,How can security metrics learn a lesson from bushfire ratings?,"Metrics are an often misunderstood valuable tool in conducting defensive cyber security operations. From understanding the workload of your staff, to understanding the effectiveness of your controls, being able to have quantitative evidence to support your business and operational decisions is critical.

This talk will discuss some of the ways to generate relevant and effective metrics for your cyber security function, taking lessons from recent changes in metrics for bushfire ratings, the Essential 8, as well as other fields. We'll also talk about metric fatigue and the crying wolf problem - how the wrong metrics can have a significantly detrimental effect on your cyber efficacy.",Iain,"Iain is the Full Spectrum Cyber Practice Lead for Leidos Australia, providing oversight and support to all of Leidos' Australian programs for cyber security including its military platform work.

At Atlassian, every new penetration tester writes a crack for Jira during their first couple of weeks. Why? Because those same tools and techniques used to pirate software are critical skills needed to perform effective security tests & research. In this talk, I‚Äôm going to teach some of those techniques to you too! We‚Äôll dive into Jira DC together with a hacker mindset, reverse engineering the logic behind its license check and exploring how we can modify and debug it.",Giuliana,"Hi!

sam-thorogood,the dangers of serverless & IAM proliferation,"grug dislikes complex software (and security model) which is like ball with million spikes, makes grug brain sore just by holding. instead grug thinks treat whole ball like sandpaper, all together low-level spiky. grug will permit small number of big spikes because easier to understand where actual risky bits are, like bear cave over there.",Sam Thorogood,I have opinions‚Ñ¢
