Rough breakdown (I am not sure I have the ordering correct here, but this is most of what I'd like to include):
1. What’s Atlassian & Jira, what does my team do (2min)
2. Why do we do this at Atlassian, and why am I teaching you? (5min)
    1. We conduct white-box security tests, code-assisted

4. How does this help you become better at finding vulns? (3min)

I don't want my talk to be overly technical. The demo should just be a quick example that encourages people to come and shows them how simple what I am talking about actually is. I will not decompile Jira DC code, I want to abstract this away since it doesn't really contribute to the goal of my talk and is do-able with free online tools easily.

But it doesn't have to be that way! Ever clicked ""Connect with Apple"" or allowed an app to access your calendar? That’s OAuth in action! Join us for a friendly and easy-to-understand exploration of OAuth, specially crafted for beginners.

In this talk, we'll break down the most important bits from the official documents (RFCs) and take you on a quick tour through OAuth history—from OAuth1 to current best practices. We'll delve into what OAuth is, how it works, and why it has evolved over the years.","blue, but fizzy",Laura Wratten and Angus Cornall,,"Laura and Angus are best friends, and Application Security Engineers at Canva.

Angus loves diving into hands-on security and helping others do the same, as well as hiking, biking and traveling. Both have mildly cursed vocabularies from years of memes that turned from ironic to regular speech :').",,"We want to introduce and cover some learnings around OAuth in a non-jargony and easy to understand way. OAuth is a topic with a lot of nuances and misunderstandings, and we'd really like to make it a little less scary for beginners by reading and summarising the key information from the RFCs and presenting it in a clear way. We would focus on OAuth from a historical lens (what is it, how it works, and then why a certain version was iterated on), and do this while updating one base diagram with new information as the standards and controls change. We hope by doing so, people can gain a better understanding of what OAuth is used for, and why certain controls exist and are important. We also hope people walk away with more empathy for themselves and others in knowing that OAuth is a hard and nuanced space.

Talk structure would be along the lines of (though might cover some flows in less detail to keep it snappy and keep people engaged):

- Intro (what/why are we talking about OAuth, what is an RFC, and why did we read all the OAuth-related ones for this talk)
- OAuth journey through time
  - Let’s share resources better! (fledgling OAuth / OAuth1): covering how it worked, what happened/went wrong when people were using it, then leading into the newer hardened flow / evolved standard that followed
  - OAuth2 Implicit flow: covering how it works, what happened/went wrong when people were using it, then leading into the newer hardened flow / evolved standard that followed
  - OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow (for authorization): covering how it works, what vulnerabilities/misuses we see in this flow, what hardening mechanisms or new standards were added?
  - OIDC (for authentication): covering how it works, what vulnerabilities/misuses we see in    this flow, what hardening mechanisms or new standards were added?
  - PKCE and emerging styles, plus a brief mention of some OAuth vulns we see today
- Learnings from history
  - People will continue using standards in weird and wacky ways we don’t expect them to

structure/general notes so far (there will be more as I work through references and ideas):
1. motivation/relevance: cyber security (or basically all computer work) are usually deeply dependent on working with other people and teams, whether that's developers, operational teams, customers or leadership.
2. tips:
    * check your own actions - reset, take a step back, note where you could be contributing to problems.
    * build working relationships with individuals - showing genuine interest in what they're working on, small talk, (respectfully mention neurodiverse communication differences and assuming good intentions), understanding their contexts and teams priorities
    * understand teams conflicting priorities and influences - operations, KPIs, management priorities, workload pressure
    * (sub point here about understanding your own team and what's affecting the relationships from your side)
    * start repairing: identify common friction, what's a misunderstanding, what can we fix in that
    * realism (optional, will sprinkle through the other sections to not down the mood):
        * sometimes, empathy doesn't fix a situation - a couple of short options for ways forward (accept, reduce, step away)
        * healthy boundaries! try not to make yourself the only face of your team - mention unequal distribution of ""glue work"" and impacts on marginalised people
3. wrapup takeaways 🥡
    * if you notice interactions with teams that cause a lot of stress or dysfunction at work, we've got a toolbox that you can pull out to see what you can do

Attack 2: arbitrary file upload to network via Microsoft Intune - free P2P malware distribution with encryption, firewall allowed, no TLS inspection, disk writes from SYSTEM. even bypasses ZTNA like Zscaler. yay for multi-tenant cloud! release scripts for upload/download

serverless is dumb and encourages everyone to create a new IAM role for every single ""thing"" - be it a lambda, docker instance, whatever - and apply custom rules about what it's allowed to do, all in the name of security isolation.

However, the proliferation of more ""things"" becomes unmanageable very quickly, both in terms of software complexity but also (relevant to purplecon) the security model of each one of those things and what they're allowed to do. And I believe it gets *worse* the bigger team you have - because no one person can rationalize about it all it tends to get ignored and skipped.

- No one shows failure but it is clearly part of the process (so it’s normal)

SECURITY LINK: Sometimes I feel like I don’t know enough to start a personal project or to do something cool in security

How to be inspired 
- Role models (show you what’s possible)
- Learning new things (inspiration comes from combining things you know)
- Making the most of your situation (tony hawk can do a 900, I can barely ollie, that’s alright)

SECURITY LINK: Sometimes I feel unmotivated or feel like I can’t make anything worthwhile

How to find success:
- Being yourself (I can’t do a kick flip, but I can do much cooler things)
- Surrounding yourself with others (they motivate and inspire)
- Send it (give it your 100% confidence, you can’t land a trick half hazardously)

SECURITY LINK: Sometimes I feel like a failure when comparing myself to peers that find ODays in Linux kernels or sandbox escapes

(c) Talk is too long as currently proposed.",,"4

they want 45+ minutes, absolutely not. we can tell them they have 20, mayyyybe 30, and help them cut down their talk to the best bits in rehersal. 
2 speakers is also a bit worrying, since i've never seen it go well, but they say it went well before
it also doesn't seem like there will be enough context for people who don't know oauth well, but again we can try and give them that feedback in rehersal.
if they accept us cutting down their talk time to 20 or 30m, then i think we should accept this",2.5,2.50,,N,,,thats.kaif@gmail.com,OAuth Hacking Marathon - Exploiting Common Security Pitfalls and Mitigating Them,"Oauth is a crucial piece of the modern technology puzzle that enables us to experience a more unified and seamless digital ecosystem. In this talk, we will showcase a series of demos that exploit various vulnerabilities both on the client side and on the authorisation server of a fictional OAuth service to show the common security pitfalls and how to navigate them.

In a cat-and-mouse chase fashion, the demos involve the developers patching the OAuth vulnerabilities, only for the hackers to identify a new, more complex attack to own the company again. These demos are inspired by real-world incidents and will illustrate how attackers actually exploit them in the wild.

OAuth gives us the immense power of letting our apps and services share data seamlessly across them. But as Uncle Ben said to Spider-Man, “With great power comes great responsibility,” OAuth can also be a blessing or a curse. And in this talk, we will explore what can go wrong with OAuth if we don’t wield this mighty power carefully.

Throughout the session, we will also discuss defensive strategies and industry best practices to tackle these attacks. Additionally, we will analyse the root causes of these vulnerabilities and discuss how the future OAuth 2.1 version helps mitigate such attacks.
So buckle up for a roller coaster live hacking marathon! ",normal snack,Kaif Ahsan,verbal-noun,"Kaif Ahsan is a coder by passion and a hacker by profession. He started his journey in tech as a Software Engineer but soon fell in love with the art of breaking software. He currently works as a Product Security Engineer at Atlassian, where his team works on helping developers ship secure products and keep them safe during cyber attacks and incidents. 

Kaif is a big proponent of education and open access to knowledge. He regularly volunteers to run cybersecurity workshops at various universities, hosts/gives talks at local meet-ups and conferences and runs the YouTube channel Everything Cyber, where he shares hands-on and conversational videos on tech and cybersecurity.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaif-ahsan/,"## Talk Structure ## 
OAuth has a lot of moving parts and without prior understanding it’s often difficult to understand why and how of various vulnerabilities relating to it. Hence, instead of just listing out the various security weaknesses in OAuth, our talk tries to take more storytelling approach to navigate the pitfalls in the technology. This way all the relevant concepts required are gradually introduced to the audience and they do not zone out due to lack of engagement. 

The two speakers will act like two hackers trying to exploit OAuth and will switch in and out between conversations among ourselves as we’re working our way through the exploits and with the audience to make them understand the issue deeper.

This narrative & demo based approach was chosen to also gradually increase the complexity of the attacks so the audience understands how and why exactly the vulnerability occurs. Finally after each demo the patching / fix section enlightens the audience of potential strategies to mitigate these type of attacks.

This narrative and conversation based methodology worked really well for a different supply chain hacking marathon talk we conducted in BSides Sydney (2023) and Bsides Brisbane (2024) so we want to replicate that to explain more complicated areas such as OAuth. 


## Outline ## 
- Introduction to OAuth 
-- We give a gentle introduction to OAuth with examples - the what, why and how. 
-- Zooming into the ‘how,’ we introduce a few pre-requisite concepts & terms that will be important to understand the attack that follows. 
--- Most of the relevant terms will be introduced as they are required for the demos.
-- We combine all the concepts to give a visual overview of the Authorization code and Implicit Code flow. 
-- As part of the introduction, we will also showcase the code and infrastructure that our fictional Everything Cyber company has set up.

- Client app exploit demos 
-- We will showcase a series of vulnerabilities that can arise from the insecure implementation of an OAuth client app. In this section, Everything Cyber will act as an OAuth client, accessing information from other services. We will showcase how an insecure client app setup can lead to account takeovers and information leaks.
-- The demos will include - 
--- Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow	
--- Forced OAuth profile linking due to flawed CSRF protection. 
--- Assignment of accounts based on the email address

-- For each demo, we will also first cover the infrastructure required so people understand typical OAuth setups. 
-- Then we will cover the fix to the problem. There will be an emphasis on the ‘why’ so audience understands the underlying mechanics. 

- Authorisation server exploit demos 
-- We will showcase how a lack of proper implementation on the authorisation server side can lead to mishaps. This time, Everything Cyber will collaborate with other apps as the resource server to allow sharing its data with others. We will see how vulnerabilities in resource and authorisation servers can lead to a myriad of issues. 
-- Our demos will include: 
--- Stealing OAuth Token via redirect_uri due to flawed redirect_uri validation. 
--- Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect
--- Stealing OAuth access tokens via a proxy page
-- We will also cover infrastructure and mitigation tactics for each attack. 
- OAuth 2.1 updates
-- We will cover the major chances upcoming in the 2.1 version and how they will help us uproot the root cause of the various issues present in 2.0.

She was hiding from an abusive ex and I helped her with securing her online presence. It made me reflect of what I’ve also done to help me when I was stalked both online and offline when I was just starting out on my career shift to tech about 2 decades ago. I gave a version of this talk to AWSN and Day of Shecurity but I asked that there was no recording to be done because of the sharing of my friend's story.

He worked for many years as a software engineer before discovering that breaking things could be more fun than building things and jumped the fence to offensive security. He has worked as a pentester for over 10 years.

this talk will be a whirlwind tour of cybersecurity topics, including things like:
Offensive Security
GRC
DFIR
AppSec
Cloud
Privacy
Threat Intel
Security Operations
AI (full disclosure, mainly going to clown on AI)


An example of the level of detail for one topic: eg: GRC - what is it? what are the most common frameworks? (eg ISO27001, NIST CSF, E8) when/where are they used and how do they interrelate? These questions will be quickly addressed, then bam, onto the next topic

I'm definitely not an expert in all these topics, but I am blessed to know people who are.
