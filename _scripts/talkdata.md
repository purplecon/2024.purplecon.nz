## the dangers of serverless & IAM proliferation

grug dislikes complex software (and security model) which is like ball with million spikes, makes grug brain sore just by holding. instead grug thinks treat whole ball like sandpaper, all together low-level spiky. grug will permit small number of big spikes because easier to understand where actual risky bits are, like bear cave over there.

## tips to build and repair empathy with other teams

Any outcome works better if the teams involved work together instead of against each other. But many teams I've worked in have had longstanding issues, misunderstandings or grudges, which caused stress and poorer work outcomes for all involved.

We'll talk through some tips, resources and mindsets i've found useful when working on repairing team relationships, both as a newcomer and when trying to reset my own mindset.

## Where Did It Come From, Where Did It Go? What the Heck is an OAuth Flow?

OAuth can feel like a big, scary monster full of techy jargon and tricky standards. But it doesn't have to be that way! Ever clicked "Connect with Apple" or allowed an app to access your calendar? That‚Äôs OAuth in action! Join us for a friendly and easy-to-understand exploration of OAuth, specially crafted for beginners.

In this talk, we'll break down the most important bits from the official documents (RFCs) and take you on a quick tour through OAuth history‚Äîfrom OAuth1 to current best practices. We'll delve into what OAuth is, how it works, and why it has evolved over the years.

## üôã‚ùìüôã why‚ùìü§î chrome üåê üôÖüö´ removed üö´üôÖ the üîí lock ü´® icon ü§∑ü§∑

if you've been particularly eagle-eyed, you might've noticed that within the past year or so, the lock icon disappeared from Chrome's address bar. this is the story of why and how that happened, and maybe it's secretly a story about HTTPS and the web ecosystem and the sisyphean task of securing the web as a whole...... 

it's just an icon, michael. how hard could it be to remove?

## It‚Äôs easier to Pirate with an Atlas‚Ä¶sian

Have you ever wondered exactly how people pirate software? What are the tools and techniques they used? At Atlassian, every new penetration tester writes a crack for Jira during their first couple of weeks. Why? Because those same tools and techniques used to pirate software are critical skills needed to perform effective security tests & research. In this talk, I‚Äôm going to teach some of those techniques to you too! We‚Äôll dive into pirating software together, exploring how we can modify and debug code.

### Giuliana

## How can security metrics learn a lesson from bushfire ratings?

Metrics are an often misunderstood valuable tool in conducting defensive cyber security operations. From understanding the workload of your staff, to understanding the effectiveness of your controls, being able to have quantitative evidence to support your business and operational decisions is critical.

This talk will discuss some of the ways to generate relevant and effective metrics for your cyber security function, taking lessons from recent changes in metrics for bushfire ratings, the Essential 8, as well as other fields. We'll also talk about metric fatigue and the crying wolf problem - how the wrong metrics can have a significantly detrimental effect on your cyber efficacy.

## plugins on fire

If you're new to security code review or bug bounties, finding vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins could be a gentle entrypoint that allows you to learn by doing, while racking up CVEs and a bit of money along the way - not to mention you'll be improving the security of thousands (or even millions!) of sites that rely on these plugins.

Come along to find out more about how you can get started (or just come for the memes, you do you). This is not a hardcore hacking talk, but there will be recommended resources for you to dive as deep as you want for homework
