## types of tickets 
last time we did some weird experimental stuff with tickets and we are back at it again. 

just like [last time](https://2019.purplecon.nz/tickets/), the tickets are split in half:

### marginalised group tickets 

are for people who identify as being from a marginalised* group in tech 

### general admission tickets 

are for anyone

## faq


## what does “marginalised” mean?
"to marginalise is to treat (a person, group, or concept) as insignificant or peripheral"

in the context of the security industry, some examples of people who tend to experience marginalisation include (but are not limited to) women, non-binaryp people, trans people, people of colour, people of different ages, people who are differently abled. this is also sometimes referred to as “social exclusion”, and it often means people from these groups have less access to rights, resources, and opportunities.

## why is it good to have people from marginalised groups?
by working together but being different to eachother, you’re stronger. in diversity, there is strength. in [experiments](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=diverse+teams), diverse teams perform better.

and, well.... if you were theoretically like... heisting a priceless diamond, who would you rather have do it with you?

* lockpicking expert, getaway driver, embedded systems hacker, diamond appraiser, lookout, social engineer
* same thing but everyone is the getaway driver

### which ticket do i choose?
we're not asking for proof or personal details, we trust you to get the ticket that best represents you.

if you're wondering whether you count as "marginalised" or not, the mere fact that you are thinking about this means you should probably choose a marginalised group ticket.

### will anyone else know which ticket type i have?
nope, the tickets grant you identical badges/everything else on the day

### why are you doing this?
we think it’s important for everyone to have the opportunity to learn from and engage with the community. this ticket experiment is a small step we can take towards creating opportunities for people with diverse backgrounds and improving representation both at our conference and in the wider infosec space. 

even if you aren't physically there, we'll be live streaming and recording the whole event. we want anyone, anywhere, to be able to astrally project themselves with great intensity into purplecon at their convenience.
