### pov u attend purplecon

on the day, you'd walk through the library halls, vibrating rapidly alongside your fellow tweens, trying to contain your excitement at being in a library.

### post-credits cutscene

a few days after purplecon we got an email that said this:
> *"I found all these stickers in a trail to the west coast. Is this a clue? Does it mean Purplecon is continuing its journey westward? Or just that purplecon is everywhere? I don't know how to use a camera, or the internet, or anything so deal."*

Jeremy helpfully replied with the following.

>*"This is amazing!!*

>*So awesome to see the stickers on your way back! Thank you for sharing the pics!*

>*The first purplecon was at the Michael Fowler Centre (MFC) in Wellington, the second purplecon at the Pipitea Marae technically about 100m east of MFC, and now 5 years later, 2225km west of MFC. This could be a polynomial fit, which extrapolates out to about 3200km west of MFC for 2025, which actually is almost exactly... Adelaide?"*
