// something about making friends, being a community
// you watch everyone else do their own special thing, make their own rebel mark. then you do it too, it's like a community. everyone puts their hands in
//strange world but everyone treats it like itâ€™s normal (like the cherry blossom petals)
//then in REAL life we hide something there also
// fake choice where you don't do what you click. "that would be ridiculous, of course"
// keep having to say no no no to tempting things, makes u REBEL
// eventually the final one is the True Ending


// vague plot
// community, friends, being together
// it's fun, you can rebel and break the rules (in dialogue choices surely)
// talk to someone? make friends?
// see everyone around you being like you, or not, but still together
// theme: community, togetherness
// become friends with a book?
// a GROUP of books? are all friends together?
// you make something with the girl. lots of options. you customise it. you get choices at each lil node along the way (like the conversation), and your final result is the combo of all your choices! maybe a drawing? you draw memories along the way?
// then you add it to the giant pile all the other added theirs to. 
// FIN 
// have a hole that's the same shape as your bracelet somewhere if you talk about it

// at the end, dialogue option for "is this the True Ending?/i hope this is the True Ending"
// i pog loud as hell, if you don't like it go to ANOTHER library
// use [EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER]
// "shhh, this is a library"
