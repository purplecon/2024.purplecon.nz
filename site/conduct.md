<h2>Code of conduct</h2>
<p>
  We would like purplecon to be a friendly event where people from every walk of life feel welcome, so weâ€™ve written out
  our expectations for behaviour from attendees, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and anyone else involved with or
  adjacent to purplecon, including spaces where people are watching the live stream and hanging out during or after the con.
</p>
<p>
  We do not tolerate harassment of anyone, in any form.
</p>
<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, or religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. This is not an exhaustive list. If you aren't sure whether you'd be harassing someone by doing a thing, don't do it.
</p>
<p>
  Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere related to or adjacent to purplecon, in person or other materials such as slides, handouts, or anything else.
</p>
<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
</p>
<p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  ejecting you from the rest of the conference, preemptively banning you from future events or contacting the appropriate
  authorities. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
  contact us immediately.
</p>
<p>
  We take all reports seriously, and will use discretion when responding to a report. We will be logging all reports that
  are made.
</p>
<p>
  To make a report, you can:
</p>
<p>
  Email: <a href="mailto:report@purplecon.nz">report@purplecon.nz</a><br>
  Call / Text / Signal: <a href="tel:+64224258493">+64 22 425 84938</a><br>
  Or find the nearest purplecon volunteer or staff member.
