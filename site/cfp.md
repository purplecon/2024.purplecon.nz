## rehearsals
we are doing some craaAaazy nonsense with talks this year.

#### it's good to practice
we're not planning on having as many hours of talks as the other girls (conferences), and we have a pretty niche <span class="fancy">Vibe</span> we're going for. we realise we're asking for a lot, so we want to help our speakers.

if your talk gets accepted, we will ask you to do one (1) rehearsal of that talk for us before the actual day of purplecon. this has a blossoming paradise of benefits, such as making sure you have actually seen your slides before you go on stage.

#### feedback
we (mangopdf) will then give you feedback on this rehearsal, and help you make your talk even better. we're not insisting you _do_ anything with this feedback, or that you have to change your talk to be how we want it or anything. it's just there if it helps. we want you to get the audience all starry-eyed, so we'll plot/scheme/mastermind your talk with you.

## what should i talk about?

we're looking for talks that are:
* **accessible**
  * the audience can understand them
* **interesting**
  * the audience is HOOKED on ur content
* **inspirational**
  * the audience learns they can _do_ something they couldn't before, sparking the flames of passion in their hearts etc. etc. or similar

they don't _strictly_ have to be about computers, security, or Business Value. but it's ok if they are we all gotta love and cherish the shareholder sometimes.

note: talk titles containing the text "for fun and profit" will be difficult to distinguish from every other talk with that same joke in it. we recommend using a more descriptive title.

## the great archive
after the conference, we will publish a collection of resources alongside your talk, written by you. this is so people can actually use your ideas days, months, or even years after the con, without having to guess which youtube video to watch (hey it's like an actual call for papers!)

we would like to see:
* your slides
* some kind of document to support your talk

if youâ€™d like us to link out to your own site/blog/minecraft server, we can definitely do that too.

## wait but that sounds scary i'm spooked 
ohhhh it's okay, little leafðŸŒ±. you will one day grow up big and strong, and we will nurture you with our watering cans.

there is an option in the cfp form to ask us for our limitless celestial guidance. we can help you write your talk, or even help you if you have a vague idea for something you might want to talk about but aren't sure how to do it. let us know! ðŸ’œ
